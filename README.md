# AE_ReservoirComputer

Welcome to the AE_ReservoirComputer repository!

This repository contains the implementation of an Artificial Echo Reservoir Computer, a type of machine learning model used for time series prediction and signal processing tasks. The reservoir computer architecture is based on the concept of a dynamical system with a large number of interconnected nodes, known as the reservoir.

## Installation

To install the AE_ReservoirComputer package, simply run the following command:

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the AE_ReservoirComputer package in your project, import it as follows:

```python
import AE_ReservoirComputer
```

Then, you can create an instance of the reservoir computer and train it on your data. Here's an example:

```python
# Create a reservoir computer
reservoir = AE_ReservoirComputer.ReservoirComputer()

# Load your data
data = load_data()

# Train the reservoir computer
reservoir.train(data)

# Make predictions
predictions = reservoir.predict(data)
